			<h3> Al Akhawayn University Since 1995, A Bond Meant To Last</h3>
			<div><p> University usually teaches us hard and soft skills, but most importantly, it teaches us what belonging is. That sense of community is what ties the women of the AWS. Starting from the first graduates of 1999, the AUI Women Society welcomes all alumnae and current AUI students, merging all backgrounds, classes, degrees and life paths into a strong community </p></div>

				<ul>
					<li><h4> Inclusiveness </h4>
						<p> Each one of us builds her own model of success and our common goal is to support her in that </p></li>
					<li><h4> Support</h4>
						<p> At the AWS, we encourage each of our members, share experiences and mutually support each other. Our society is here to help working moms and single ladies to reach their professional goals while still maintaining a fulfilling life </p></li>	
					<li><h4> Openness </h4><p> We believe that women shouldn't be shamed for working nor taking care of their kids. What counts the most is how good they feel about their lives </p></li>

			<h3> Concretely speaking, what do we do?</h3>
			<p> Well, first of all, the AWS is very proud to have a vibrant Facebook group where posts, advices, opportunities and experiences are constantly shared. But, we also exists in real life! We like to regularly meet, as that intensifies and reinforces the bond between us. Whether it's a workshop or a group discussion, meeting each other develops the trust we have amongst each other. It's also an opportunity to share feelings, stories or concerns, with the aim of getting proper advice and support </p>
